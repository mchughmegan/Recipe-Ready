# Recipe-Ready

## Description

Recipe Ready uses two APIs, Spoonacular and Calorie Ninjas, with the framework of Bulma, to solve your recipe making decisions (and budget!), before you get to the grocery store. Additionally technologies that helped bring Recipe Ready to your device include Google Fonts, jQuery, Trello, Figma, Pexels, Google Docs, and Google Slides.
